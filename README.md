# React Coding Challenges

A series of easy -> hard React.js coding challenges.

# When could these be useful?
- Short coding exercises, such as in interviews
- To test yourself/try and think of different solutions to problems
- For beginners looking for a fun way to learn React 

# How Do They Work?
The scaffolding is done for you. Simply run `yarn` in any of the directories to start the application. Each application has a README with its requirements.

# What's coming next?
I'll be adding new coding challenges as I come up with ideas! If you have any ideas I can build, contact me via www.alexgurr.com.
