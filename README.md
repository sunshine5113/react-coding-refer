A series of **ReactJS coding challenges** with a variety of difficulties. Deep dive into the why [here](https://dev.to/alexgurr/react-coding-challenges-for-interviews-beginners-1hlk).

&nbsp;
## The Challenges
### Easy üôÇ
##### üöÄ [Rocket Ship](https://github.com/alexgurr/react-coding-challenges/tree/master/rocket-ship)
Unecessary re-renders, fine grained control 

&nbsp;
### Medium üòê
##### üåô [Dark Mode](https://github.com/alexgurr/react-coding-challenges/tree/master/dark-mode)
State/Shared State, DOM manipulation

Data visualisation and graphing. API usage

&nbsp;
### Hard üò¨
##### üéß [Spootify](https://github.com/alexgurr/react-coding-challenges/tree/master/spootify)
Loading state, API usage 

##### ü§ñ [Chatter](https://github.com/alexgurr/react-coding-challenges/tree/master/chatter)
Web sockets, events, callbacks & React hooks. Talks to [Botty](https://github.com/alexgurr/botty)

&nbsp;
## When could these be useful?
- Usage as short coding exercises, such as for interviews
- To test yourself/test your coding abilities under pressure
- For beginners looking for a fun way to learn React 

&nbsp;
## How do they work?
The scaffolding is done for you. Simply run `yarn` in any of the directories to start the application. Each application has a README with its requirements.

Some might require connection to external APIs, but all information will be provided in the inididual challenge readmes.

&nbsp;
## Have you got the solutions?
I have completed all the coding challenges to a high standard. Get invited to the solutions repository at [solutions.alexgurr.com](https://www.solutions.alexgurr.com).

#### Why are the solutions invite only?
People use these challenges for interviews. By putting the solutions behind a collaboration wall/invite-only repository we can discourage candidates from simply looking up the solutions. We track current/past collaborators, meaning if you want to check if a potential candidate had access/looked at the solutions you can get in touch and find out. 

&nbsp;
## Why does it take so long for updates/new challenges?
I work on these challenges & solutions in my spare time, on top of a full time job and all the other stuff. Because of this, I don't always get a lot of time to maintain and add new challenges. Interested in becoming a collaborator or submitting your own challenge? **Reach out below.**
